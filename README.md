# AI Image Generator
The below approach can be utilised to build an AI image generator website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript:

Define a webpage with meta tags, title, and sections for headings, input form, and image display.
Styles the webpage layout, form elements, and adjusts container and image styles responsively.
Manages form submission, fetches random images based on entered text, and handles errors.
Utilizes media queries to adjust container width and image height for different screen sizes.
Provides error messages for failed image fetch requests and empty input fields.
